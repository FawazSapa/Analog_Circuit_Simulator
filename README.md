Created an Analog Circuit Simulator using a cost function with a heuristic algorithm, which is used to guess the current for a particular instant in time within a tolerance. and using OpenGl for the graphics.
While keeping in mind the triple constraints of project managament.Here I assumed the scheduling, cost estimation (assume $50 per person-hour), and quality assurance.
